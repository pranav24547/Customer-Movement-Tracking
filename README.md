Customer Movement Tracking and Path Analysis System Using YOLOv8

This project aims to develop an intelligent customer tracking and movement path analysis system using YOLOv8 deep learning model to help businesses understand customer behavior inside stores, malls, and commercial spaces. The system detects customers in real-time video streams and tracks their movement paths to analyze foot traffic patterns and engagement zones.

Using computer vision and artificial intelligence, the system identifies individual customers, assigns unique tracking IDs, and records their movement trajectories across different areas of the store. This data helps business owners optimize product placement, improve store layout, and enhance customer experience.

The project is implemented using Python, YOLOv8, OpenCV, and Deep Learning techniques, enabling high-speed detection and accurate tracking even in crowded environments. The collected movement data can be visualized as heatmaps or path graphs to support data-driven business decisions.

This solution eliminates the need for manual observation and provides automated, real-time analytics for retail management and marketing strategy improvement.
