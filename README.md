# 🧠 Customer Movement Tracking and Path Analysis System Using YOLOv8

An AI-powered computer vision system that detects, tracks, and analyzes customer movement patterns in real time using YOLOv8 deep learning model. This project helps businesses understand customer behavior, optimize store layouts, improve product placement, and enhance overall customer experience through automated video analytics.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This system uses real-time video streams from CCTV cameras or live webcams to detect customers, assign unique tracking IDs, and record their movement trajectories. The collected data is processed to generate visual insights such as movement paths, footfall distribution, and heatmaps for data-driven retail decision making.

By eliminating manual observation, the system enables automated, accurate, and scalable customer analytics for smart retail environments.
